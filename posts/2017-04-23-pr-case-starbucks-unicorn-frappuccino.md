          Starbucks is at the forefront of the coffee industry. The organization currently has over 24,000 retail stores in over 70 countries. The first Starbucks opened in 1971 in Seattle, Washington at Pikes Place Market. The store is still in operation and is often an attraction for tourists and locals alike according to Lewis (n.d.). Starbucks offers over 30 blends of coffee along with teas, smoothies, blended drinks, fresh food, merchandise and even has ready to drink items sold at various markets and stores. In recent years Starbucks has also began to offer Via Instant Coffee, pods for Starbucks’ instant coffee maker, and K-cup pods for Keurig machines. Starbucks offers seasonal and limited-time only products in addition to its permanent menu items.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          According to Starbucks Investor Relations’ (2017) fiscal reporting, the company is up in sales globally and in the U.S., up in revenue, and up in operating income. It was also reported that in its 2nd Quarter of 2017 the company’s consolidated net revenue came in at $5.3 billion which was up six percent (Starbucks Investor Relations, 2017). Starbucks’ 2017 fiscal reporting also includes reports of non-monetary categories such as rewards program information and other information shareholders may be interested in. The 2017 report notes Starbucks increased U.S. membership in their rewards program to 13.3 million members (Starbucks Investor Relations, 2017).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Business Goal</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Starbucks states that its mission is “to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time” (Starbucks, 2017). Starbucks also has a list of values <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">that they and their partners live by, including: creating a culture of warmth and belonging where all are welcome; acting with courage while challenging the company to grow, being present; delivering their best in everything they do (Starbucks, 2017). Starbucks (2017) also notes in their mission statement that they are “performance driven, through the lens of humanity.” Starbucks is committed to being a company that is involved in the community, committed to their environment, and to ethical sourcing of coffee. Starbucks’ goal for 2020 is to have 100% ethically-sourced coffee, to train 200,000 coffee farmers, and to invest $50 million in funding for farmers (Starbucks, 2017).</span>

          <strong>Statement of Problem</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Starbucks customers are not purchasing enough new menu items or products. Even though sales are up both globally and internationally overall, Starbucks is not seeing this same positive increase with any of their new offers. Contributing to this problem, is the fact that not every menu item is shown on the menu in-stores, in the drive-thru, or in the Starbucks app. Starbucks offers over 250 items in stores (Jargon, 2014). With such a large number of menu items it is not feasible for Starbucks to list every single one on their items on the menu for customers to see when ordering. Starbucks sees social media as great opportunity to influence customers to purchase new products. Social media can also be used as a tool to inform consumers of new offers as well.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Research Goals and Methodology</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Before developing the program it is suggested Starbucks does specific research on social media and the influence it has on increasing sales of menu items. Starbucks should also do research on popular social media hashtags and trends. Another research method Starbucks can use, is to look at its own organization in social media. How often do people post about their Starbucks drinks? What platforms does this occur on most often? Is it with new drinks, old favorites, or both?

          <strong>Situation Analysis</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <em>Strengths</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Starbucks is a very large corporation with a loyal fan base and over 13 million members are registered and use their rewards program. Many customers of Starbucks go every day, or even multiple times a day. In 2013 Starbucks reported having 500 customers in one day and it is expected to grow to over 750 customers per day (Lutz, 2013). Starbucks is a very well-known brand whose logo can be recognized by almost anyone and everyone across the globe. In a poll where respondents were questioned about brand awareness, over 90 percent of people agreed that they recognized the company’s logo (BrandIndex, 2014). Starbucks also has a very strong social media presence- not just created through its own posts, but from consumer posts as well. Starbucks has 14.6 million Instagram followers, 11.9 million Twitter followers, and almost 37 million likes on Facebook. Starbucks has abundant financial resources. The popular brand has had increasing sales both within the United States and globally (Starbucks Investor Relations, 2017).

          <em>Weaknesses</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Weaknesses within the campaign that might occur include opposition to the sugary drinks from activists. “The Food Babe” often discourages both adults and children from consuming Starbucks drinks and food items claiming they are made with bad ingredients and are not a healthful choice for consumers. Expensive menu items may serve as a weakness for Starbucks <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">when trying to sell or market new products. The massive expansion that Starbucks has experienced could hinder Starbucks’ efforts.</span>

          <em>Opportunities</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The heavy social media use of generation X, millennials, and generation Y is an obvious opportunity for Starbucks. Starbucks has been successful in garnering followers on social media and encouraging customers to post about the company on social media. Loyal Starbucks customers will often post about their first fall drink, or a winter favorite on social media (i.e. Pumpkin Spice and Peppermint Mocha). Foodie culture is also an opportunity that can be taken advantage of. Consumers are always looking for the next popular item and where to get it. This foodie culture can tie into social media as well where people are constantly trying to post new and exciting snacks, meals, or drinks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <em>Threats</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          A larger social media event taking the spotlight off of Starbucks. There is no predicting what types of events or promotions will take over social media as trends are constantly changing and it can sometimes be very difficult to keep up. Relying on consumers’ use of social media marketing can also be difficult. Cheaper competition such as McDonald’s can pose a threat. McDonald’s serves coffee products and food for a much lower price. New organizations entering the market. Boutique and smaller coffee shops are becoming increasingly popular.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <em>Strategic Implications</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To implement a successful campaign Starbucks will need to take advantage of its various social media platforms that already have a large following and are already successful in encouraging social media users to post about Starbucks and its products. The organization’s large <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">financial resources can also help it overcome other trends or promotions that may overshadow Starbucks’ campaign. Starbucks can also use its large brand awareness to dominate the market even with cheaper options that are available, as well as new organizations that have entered the market or may be looking to enter the market.</span>

          <strong>Communication Goals</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Starbucks is facing a problem of customers not purchasing new products and of customers not being fully aware of the products Starbucks has to offer. In order to solve the communication problem Starbucks is facing there are some communication goals that need to be accomplished. The first goal is for Starbucks to influence customers to purchase more new products. Starbucks also intends to show consumers they are aware of social media trends and will execute projects to give consumers their desires. Starbucks also has a goal of creating a social media campaign that causes consumers to engage with Starbucks on social media which will then create more awareness of the new products Starbucks will be offering.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Objectives</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In order to be sure Starbucks is accomplishing the communication goals there are certain objectives that need to met. The first objective that needs to be met in order to accomplish the goals is to increase sales of new products by five percent in the next quarter. While Starbucks’ most recent financial reports indicate an overall increase in sales, Starbucks is looking to specifically increase the sales of new products. Starbucks also needs to see an increase by eight percent of in-store traffic generated by social media promotions by the end of April. Lastly, the organization needs to increase social media mentions of products. Instagram should see an increase by 15 percent, Twitter should see an increase by ten percent, and Facebook should see <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">an increase by five percent. Starbucks plans to generate 20 social media posts across all channels using the campaign hashtag prior to the campaign. During the campaign there should be two social media posts per day.</span>

          <strong>Audiences</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Starbucks has a wide range of stakeholders, but for this particular problem there are a few key audiences that need to be reached. Starbucks needs to target its rewards customers. There are over 13 million rewards program members and these customers need to be made aware of new products that Starbucks is offering. Repeat customers may have favorite drinks and might order the same item each time they visit, but they need to be introduced to the new products Starbucks will offer.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Another key audience for the organization is heavy social media users. People ages 35-49 are now seen as the heaviest social media users just above millennials (Casey, 2017). This audience is important as one of the goals for Starbucks is to create a successful social media campaign to create product awareness. Other key audiences are children. Children often visit stores with their parents so marketing to this demographic is essential. By creating awareness of new products in people under the age of 16 this will encourage them to look for new items being offered as they become regular customers of Starbucks.

          <strong>Messages</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          There are three key messages Starbucks is trying to communicate to the key audiences.<br /> • Starbucks is in tune with consumers and stays on top of social media trends
        </p>
        
        <p>
          • Starbucks is more than what is on their menu- we have seasonal drinks, and a secret menu, and we often offer new products we offer
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">• Starbucks offers not only traditional coffee drinks and flavors, but a wide variety of drinks and flavors for all customers. We have something for everyone.</span>

          <strong>Strategies</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Create a limited edition product that captures the interest of a wide-range of ages and can be enjoyed by all ages. It doesn’t only want to get coffee lovers through the door, but children, teens, and others who may not want caffeinated drinks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Align the new product launch with a popular social media trend; the unicorn by creating the Unicorn Frappuccino. Offer the product for a limited time to create urgency and maximize the potential for social media hype, which should bring people into the stores who will not want to miss out on their only chance to try the product.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Tactics</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Release the Unicorn Frappuccino on April 19th, shortly after National Unicorn Day and capitalize on the rarity of the unicorn by making it available for a limited time (five days).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Encourage use of the social media hashtag “#UnicornFrappuccino” over various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Emphasize the unique appearance and ingredients of the Unicorn Frappuccino including colors true to the mystical creature &#8212; a mix of purple and blue, very similar to the unicorn emoji located in the emoji keyboard on the iPhone so people can match the unicorn emoji to their drinks in social media posts &#8211; and &#8211; a caffeine-free blend of sour and sweet flavors. Promote the drink’s color changing and flavor changing characteristics to entice and attract the younger audience.
        </p>

      <div class="column">
        <p>
          Capitalize on the social media trend by creating a hashtag which will reach consumers all over various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Create social media hype about Starbucks and get customers in the door buying a product.
